## First steps: installing dependencies

In order to create the API we'll need some dependencies. Prior to create the APIhowever, we need to create a database-like structure to get the items from. But first, we'll download the following libraries:

> Remember to initialize the virtual environment with ``pipenv shell``. You'll also need to install pip to get pipenv running. Go [here](https://pipenv-es.readthedocs.io/es/latest/) and [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to geth both pip and pipenv. You'll also need Flask, so go [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/) as well.

```
pipenv install Flask-SQLAlchemy
pipenv install flask-marshmallow
pipenv install marshmallow-sqlalchemy
```

Now with all of that in place, we can start building the database that will allow us (later on) to create the API itself.

But first we'll create an **app.py** file to create a Flask app. This will be our "root" file.

```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hey Flask"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

We can now type ``python app.py`` to run the app on localhost:5000.
